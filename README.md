### 🧑‍💻 About Me

I’m an **Electronics & Communication Engineer** with a deep interest in the intersection of **hardware systems** and **software applications**. My core focus lies in:

- **Embedded Systems Development**  
- **Backend Engineering with Python**  
- **GUI Design & Automation**  
- **VLSI Design and Digital Logic**  

I believe in building tools that are simple, useful, and meaningful — whether that means writing Python scripts, simulating VLSI circuits, or designing embedded prototypes.
